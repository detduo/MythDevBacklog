LocalScript

The script gets the Players and RunService services and the local player, local character, and local humanoid objects.

It gets the current floor material of the character's humanoid.

It defines a table called SOUND_DATA that contains the information for the different sounds that can be played.

It defines two helper functions: waitForFirst and map.

It defines several functions that initialize and play sounds and that set up the sound system.

The initializeSoundSystem function sets up the sound system for the player's character. It creates a Sound object for each sound defined in the SOUND_DATA table and sets its properties accordingly. It also defines a table called playingLoopedSounds that keeps track of which sounds are currently playing.

The stateTransitions table defines functions that get called when the player's character changes state. These functions stop any currently playing sounds, play the appropriate sound for the new state, and set the playingLoopedSounds table accordingly.

The script sets up event listeners for the player's character's state transition events and calls the appropriate stateTransitions function when the state changes.
