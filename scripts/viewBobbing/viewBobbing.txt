LocalScript


The script starts by getting references to various objects and services, including the local player, mouse, camera, and UserInputService.

The script defines several variables, including some functions and values that are used later on.

The script creates a connection to the "RenderStepped" event, which fires every frame. This connection updates the camera position and orientation based on the movement of the player's character.

Within the RenderStepped event, the script checks if the player's character is still alive. If not, it disconnects the event to stop updating the camera.

The script calculates the magnitude of the player's velocity and applies some smoothing to it.

The script calculates various functions and values based on the current time and the player's velocity.

The script updates the camera's CFrame (position and orientation) based on the various functions and values calculated in step 6.

The script updates the camera's zoom distance.

The script calculates a vector that represents the direction the camera is facing, and applies some smoothing to it.
